 * Transcription
 *
 *  In mathematics, a category (sometimes called an abstract category to distinguish
 *  it from a concrete category) is a Set of "objects" that are linked by "arrows".
 *  A category has two basic properties: the ability to compose the arrows associatively
 *  and the existence of an identity arrow for each object.
 *
 *  A simple example is the category of sets whose objects are sets and whose arrows are
 *  functions."
