# Studios Slab
## Aka "the anything bagel"
 
This repo is where I've amalgamated most of my physics PhD code. Discrete time-advancement of (classic) Klein-Gordon-like field theories (with non-differentiable potentials) and also path integrals of their quantum counterparts in a stochastic formalism. Also, as studies, montecarlo of magnetic models and Langevin dynamics of soft matter.

It is mostly C++ but, because jupyter notebooks get so big, github thinks it is mostly Jupiter.

It also contains most of my coding projects of all sorts and own libraries of common functionality.

The root folder contains the base CMakeFiles. This includes all C++ targets.

A few screenshots:
