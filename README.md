# Studios Slab
## Aka "the anything bagel"

This repo is where I've amalgamated most of my physics PhD code. Path integrals but also classical field simulation of non-differentiable potentials.

It is mostly C++ but, because jupyter notebooks get so big, github thinks it is mostly Jupiter.

It also contains most of my coding projects of all sorts and own libraries of common functionality.

The root folder contains the base CMakeFiles. This includes all C++ targets.
