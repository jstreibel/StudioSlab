What if it becomes cheap to build immense ecosystems, suburbs and colonies in LEO? What if they become parallel/new States?
What if, amidst growing notions of a Metaverse and Blockchain, we start contacting aliens?
What if many people prefer to live their lives inside these worlds? And people get to essentially choose their reality.
What if it is not obvious if it is aliens or just another lie?
What if these aliens are not EM but some other substract of physics, and communication runs through novel technology?
What if they really look and feel like spirits? What if they are not that bound by shape? What if we build them avatars in this world?
What if the nuclide table has other stabilty islands, and these elements have enough density to interact with other, parallel fields?
What if some of these elements are already (albeit very scarce) well used inside our brains to communicate with this seeminlgy parallel world?
What if we solve the mystery of quantum gravity? Of algebra and geometry, of language and senses.


How?

How does one distinguish a demon from an angel?






There was a race to get to space. Many reasons. My particular ones were two: the utility of it, 
and the sheer romantic beauty. I'm not sure if this is a pervasive feeling, but even in the hardest
